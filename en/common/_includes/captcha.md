I can't enter a captcha

: In the captcha, enter all the letters, punctuation marks, and other characters you see. Pay attention to lowercase and uppercase letters (match the case).
    
    Enter text from both images. Put one space between the words from the images.
    
    If there are characters that you can't enter, get a new captcha, but don't do this too often â€” the system may mistake you for a robot and ban your account.

    After entering the captcha, you will be shown a notification saying if it was entered correctly. If a new captcha appeared after entering it, it means the characters you entered were incorrect. Try entering the captcha more carefully.

    If the characters on the captcha are too small, zoom in on the browser page. To do this, hold down the **Ctrl** (for OS X, hold down **Cmd**) and press the **+** and **-** keys.

I was banned

    Enter the captcha carefully. The system may ban you due to frequent errors or frequent captcha updates. If you are banned again, you may lose access to tasks.

Captcha is shown too often

    The captcha is shown to all performers, regardless of their experience and number of completed tasks.

Why is the captcha in English?
