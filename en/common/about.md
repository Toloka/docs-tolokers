# About

[Toloka]({{ toloka }}) is a platform where you can earn money by [completing tasks](tasks.md).

There are different types of tasks:

- Field tasks. You get a point on the map that you need to go to and, for example, find an organization (such as a cafe or store), find their business hours, or take a photo.
- Regular tasks. You don't need to go anywhere to complete them.
    
Completed tasks are [checked](priemka.md) by the requester. The results are used to evaluate your [skills](skills.md).

The prices are set by requesters. You can [withdraw funds](pay/about.md) in different ways, depending on your country.
