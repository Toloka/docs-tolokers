## Types of awards {#section_qsd_fmr_r3b}

- **For knowledge of Toloka.** Complete a training task, field task, or mobile task, earn your first money, and withdraw it from your Toloka account.
- **For activity.** Users get these awards for performing different actions on the platform. Like turning on push notifications or inviting friends to Toloka.
- **Multilevel awards** are given for reaching a certain skill level. With each new level, you get a new award.

   {% cut "Example" %}

   The "In the know" Level 1 award is given for completing 10 training tasks. Level 2 is awarded for completing 100 training tasks, and so on. Level 5 is the highest.
