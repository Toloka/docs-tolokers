## Types of awards {#section_qsd_fmr_r3b}

- **For knowledge of Toloka.** Complete a training task, field task, or mobile task, earn your first money, and withdraw it from your Toloka account.

- **For activity.** Users get these awards for performing different actions on the platform, like turning on push notifications or inviting friends to Toloka.

- **Multi-level awards** are given for reaching a certain skill level. With each new level, you get a new award.

    {% cut "Example" %}

    You get the first level of the "In the know" award for completing ten training tasks; the second level is awarded for completing one hundred training tasks, and so on. The fifth level is the highest.
