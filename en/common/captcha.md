# Entering captchas

In Toloka, captchas are entertaining mini games that can distract you from your tasks for a few seconds. The games are simple, quick, and easy. The captchas don&apos;t contain any foreign words, only pictures and clear symbols. At the same time, captchas are good at protecting Toloka from robots and cheaters.

## Примеры капчи {#example-captcha}

- **Three in a row**

  In this captcha, you need to put three identical images in one row or column. To move an element, click it, then click the cell that&apos;s above it, under it, to the right, or to the left from it. This mini game always has a solution where it&apos;s enough to move one element to line up three identical images.
