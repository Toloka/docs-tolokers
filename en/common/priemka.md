# Tasks under review

Some tasks undergo a review. The requester can reject a task if it isn't completed according to the instructions. Rejected tasks are not paid for.

## How long does the review take? {#deadline}

The review may take several days. The maximum and average review period is specified in the task information.

## How do I get the results? {#result}

The history of completed tasks can be viewed on the page [**Profile → History**]({{ toloka-profile-history }}).

To view your results, go to the  page. There you can view the full history of completed tasks (total earnings and the number of accepted and rejected tasks), as well as statistics for the day. To view statistics, click the button with the number of completed tasks next to the date.
