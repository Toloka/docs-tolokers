# How and why to become self-employed

## Why become self-employed {#section_xw4_qdp_bmb}

_Self-employed_ are individuals who carry out professional activities without being employed, but get an official income, pay a fixed rate of tax, and manage their insurance payments on their own.

If all of your earnings are official, you can get a tax deduction. In addition, no limitations are imposed on you if you take a mortgage loan or apply for a tourist visa.

You'll have to pay a 6% [self-employment tax]({{ nalog-npd }}) on your earnings. You don't need to pay the tax if you don't earn anything in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}).

If you haven't reached your [tax deduction limit]({{ self-employed-state }}) (10,000 rubles) yet, then you'll be charged a tax rate of 4% instead of 6%. The remaining 2% will be automatically exempt from the tax deduction limit.

## Limitations {#common-info}

- Only citizens of Russia can be self-employed. Individual entrepreneurs can't become self-employed if they pay taxes under the simplified taxation system. If you want to be self-employed and maintain the status of an individual entrepreneur, switch to a different tax regime. [More about tax statuses]({{ nalog-taxation-type-choice }}).

- Self-employed individuals can withdraw funds to [YooMoney](../pay/yoomoney.md) and via [FPS](../pay/sbp.md).

- If you receive unemployment payments (pension, benefits, or subsidies), check in advance whether you will lose them by becoming self-employed. You can check with the organizations that issue your payments, such as the Pension Fund.

- If you later cancel your self-employment status, you will no longer be able to complete projects and withdraw money from your [Toloka]({{ toloka }}) account.
