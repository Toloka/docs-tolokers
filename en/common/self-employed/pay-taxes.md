# Tax payment

Information about your earnings is transferred to the Tax Service automatically. You'll be charged the 6% for the [self-employment tax]({{ nalog-npd }}) on the amount of your earnings.

**You pay the tax yourself.** We don't debit this amount when you withdraw money.

The amount due will be displayed in your [account]({{ nalog-npd-lk }}) in the **My Taxes** system. You should pay the tax no later than the 25th of the following month. You can do this using a bank card or by paying a bill.
