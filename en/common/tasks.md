# How to be a successful Toloker

Follow these simple rules:

- Provide your real data during registration.
- Use only one account.
- Don't use scripts or bots.
- Complete projects carefully.
- Communicate with requesters and the support team in a constructive, business-like manner.

{% note tip %}

Sometimes, you need advice to complete projects efficiently and use the platform correctly. If you need clarification on a project, contact the requester via [personal messages]({{ toloka-messages }}). If you have a question about using the platform, or something doesn't work, contact support.

|| A young engineer who spends his evenings online and uses weekends to go out and meet up with friends. He has been successfully using Toloka for a long time. We'll tell you how. | An IT specialist with incomplete higher education who specializes in website development. He uses Toloka as an additional source of income. He has registered recently and has already encountered problems. Let's find out what he did wrong. ||
|| **Registration** | ||
|| {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Vanya{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}Tom{% endif %} provides his real personal data on all online services he uses. He sees no point in deceiving anyone. When registering in Toloka, he provided his passport details correctly and has been successfully earning money for several years. | {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} usually registers with fictitious names or nicknames. When registering in Toloka, he used a fictitious first and last name and found himself unable to withdraw the money. When he was asked to confirm that the account belongs to him, {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} couldn't do it because the name in the account and in the documents didn't match. ||
|| **Using the account** | ||
|| {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Vanya{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}Tom{% endif %} knows that according to the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}), he can have only one Toloker account in Toloka. He registered one account and successfully uses it both on the website and in the mobile app. He safeguards the security of his username and password and doesn't give access to his account to anyone. | {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} decided to register several accounts at once despite the rules, hoping to earn more. As a result, he was caught by the antifraud checks (Toloka has an antifraud system for monitoring and preventing fraudulent behavior.

|| **Completing projects** | ||
|| {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Vanya{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}Tom{% endif %} believes in earning an honest living.

No wonder {% if locale == "ru-com" %}he{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}he{% endif %} has high skill levels in a variety of projects. He has access to the most difficult and well-paid projects and gets bonuses. After a week of using Toloka, {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} decided to make his life a little easier. He wrote some scripts, and started to complete projects automatically. "Great! Now I can earn some passive income," {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} thought. But soon Toloka algorithms banned him for using scripts. ||
|| **Confidential information** | ||
|| {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Vanya{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}Tom{% endif %} tells his friends about Toloka, shares his referral link, and helps them find their way around the platform. But he remembers that all data in Toloka is confidential and doesn't share screenshots of projects with friends or post them in social networks. {% if locale == "ru-com" %}His{% elsif locale == "en-com" %}His{% endif %} friends successfully complete projects and increase his earnings. | {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} believes that any way to make money is good and distributes his [referral link](referal.md) through viral emails. {% if locale == "ru-com" %}Oleg{% elsif locale == "en-com"%}Greg{% endif %} also makes videos of how he completes training and posts screenshots of completed projects in social networks. Moderators noticed this, excluded him from the referral program, and blocked his access to Toloka for disclosing confidential information. Now he can't make his own money or get a percentage of his friends earnings. ||

## What not to do in Toloka {#donot}

We make sure that Tolokers follow the rules of the platform, so we check the information they provide.

Toloka has an antifraud system for monitoring and preventing fraudulent behavior. It monitors Toloker behavior and blocks suspicious accounts. In different cases, the ban may be caused by different reasons, and we are not always able to remove it. Sometimes, the account may be blocked again after unblocking.

So do not:

- Use the platform if you are under 18.
- Provide invalid data during registration or in your profile.
- Use multiple accounts.
- Use scripts or bots or try to earn dishonestly.
- Complete projects poorly.
- Make frequent mistakes when entering captchas, enter them carelessly, or skip them.

## How to proceed if you are banned {#ifbanned}

Temporary bans may apply in certain cases, such as repeatedly failing a captcha test, which triggers a block and prompts you to verify your human identity. While the first block is likely to be lifted, frequent captcha mistakes or more severe violations (e.g., bot usage) may result in a permanent ban from projects.

Once blocked, you will receive two communications: an automated notification informing you of the block and an administrator's message saying if itâ€™s possible to unblock the account. If unblocking is possible, follow the steps outlined in the message. Typically, to recall the ban, you will need to:

1. Click on the link provided in the message and complete the feedback form.
1. Submit a selfie with yourself holding a document that confirms your identity. Ensure the images are clear, and the document's photo, as well as your first and last name and date of birth, are visible and legible.
1. Await a decision, which usually takes several days to review.
