Contact the [support service]({{ support-passport-nosms-form }}).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I can't register because my phone number is already linked to another account" %}

Your phone number can only be linked to one [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/tolokers/) account at a time. Most likely, you already registered in the system using a different social network. Try to remember it. If you have any problems, contact the [support service]({{ support-passport-nosms-form }}).

According to the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}):

- The user may have only one account in Toloka.
- Re-registration is prohibited.
- The user must have a unique phone number.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I change the phone number in my account?" %}

1. Log in to the web version of [Toloka]({{ toloka }}).
2. Go to the **Profile** tab.
3. In the **Telephone** block, click **Edit**.
4. Enter a new phone number and click **Confirm**. We will send a text message to this phone number.

{% endnote %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Where to find your username in the web version of Toloka?" %}

In the web version of Toloka, your username is shown in the upper-right corner, next to the avatar. If your name or nickname is displayed next to the avatar, click on the avatar. The username will be shown in the window that opens.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Where do I view my username in the mobile app?" %}

If you use the Toloka mobile app, choose the platform:

{% list tabs %}

- Android

  Open the menu by tapping ![](../assets/menu.svg) at the top of the screen. Your username is at the top next to the avatar.

  Tap ![](../assets/settings.png). You'll see your username in the **{{ mobile_android_profile }}** section.

- iOS

  Open your **{{ mobile_ios_profile }}**. Your username is under your name.

{% endlist %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I don't remember my username or password" %}

If you don't remember your password, restore it in the social network with which you registered on the platform. Toloka doesn't store any passwords.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Repeated registration in Toloka" %}

According to the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}):

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Account blocked" %}

Under [How to be a successful Toloker](../tasks.md), we describe the most frequent causes of bans and offer tips on how to prevent them

If you get a ban, you will receive two messages:
1. An automated notification indicating the ban.
1. An administrator's message regarding the potential for unblocking.

If recalling the ban is possible, follow the instructions outlined in the message and await a decision, which typically takes several days to review.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Questions about a profile" %}

{% cut "Why don't I see all my skills in my profile?" %}

Not all skills are displayed in your profile. It depends on the skill settings and the type of project.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Can several Tolokers use the same account?" %}

No. Transferring your account to another person is a violation of Section 5.2 of the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "What are awards for?" %}

Awards can help you track your achievements and discover more Toloka features.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "When are awards given?" %}

Awards are given within 24 hours after you achieve the desired result. If the award doesn't appear in your profile within a few days, please contact the Toloka support service.

{% endcut %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Questions about projects" %}

{% cut "How do I choose a project?" %}

The list of projects shows the projects available to you at the moment. Each of them has a short description and price. Choose a project and complete it.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "What are free projects for?" %}

Training projects are generally not paid for. They are used to teach Tolokers to perform a particular kind of project and select those who show the best results. You get access to the main, paid project only after you successfully complete the training.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Low project cost" %}

The cost of the project directly depends on its complexity and how much time it takes to complete it. Simple projects that don't require special skills and a lot of time cost less than more complex ones. But the better you cope with them, the higher their cost will be and the more chances there are to get a bonus from the requester.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Maximum and average earnings" %}

The maximum earnings displayed in the project card show how much three of the most active Tolokers earn on average per day.
The average earnings displayed in the project card show how much you can earn on the project per hour on average.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I remove a reservation from a project??" %}

After the expiration of the allotted period, the reservation is automatically removed and the projects return to the main page. You can remove the reservation manually. To do this, go to the project, click **‚Üê** and select {% if platform=="android" or platform=="web" %}**{{ mobile_android_dialog_going_back_negative }}**{% elsif platform == 'ios' %}**{{ mobile_ios_task_action_refuse }}**{% endif %}. The option to reserve projects is provided for Tolokers' convenience. If for some reason you can't complete the projects you have reserved, it doesn't affect the availability of other projects or your performance in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Questions about the content of projects" %}

{% cut "The project contains adult content" %}

According to the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}), projects in Toloka may contain "adult" (including pornographic) content. Your actions in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}) that have to do with evaluating "adult content" don't violate the law. The Toloka service operates in accordance with the legislation of the Swiss Confederation and is aimed, among other things, at identifying materials of an offensive or pornographic nature. If this type of material is unacceptable to you, turn off the **{{ ui_core_profile_editor__label__allow_adult }}** option in the {% if platform == 'web' %}[profile]({{ toloka-profile }}){% else %}profile{% endif %}.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The project requires recording a video or sending a photo" %}

Projects in which Tolokers are asked to record a video or audio or take a photo are not prohibited in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}). If for some reason you don't want to complete this type of project, select another project from the list of available projects.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The project requires recording a video or sending a photo" %}

Projects in which Tolokers are asked to record a video or audio or take a photo are not prohibited in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}). If for some reason you don't want to complete this type of project, select another project from the list of available projects.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The project contains a virus" %}

Requesters check their projects before posting and try to make sure they don't contain malicious links. The virus can only appear if the content of the site you access from the project has changed after the project was posted. According to Section 4.7 of the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}), Toloka does not guarantee that projects won't contain viruses and other malicious components. When completing projects, the Toloker is solely responsible for the consequences of using the Toloka platform, including the damage that may be caused to software or hardware. If you encounter an infected site, notify the author of the project immediately.

{% note tip %}

Install antivirus software to prevent threats. This will be useful not only for completing projects in [Toloka]({{ toloka }}) but also for visiting other sites.

{% endnote %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "The project is in an unfamiliar language" %}

If you encounter projects in an unfamiliar language, don't complete them.

{% endcut %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Questions about a particular project" %}

Projects are posted and checked by requesters. If you have a question about the completion of a particular project, contact the requester directly. To do this, find the project in the **Available**, **Reserved**, or **Done** section, open the project, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select **{{ ui_worker_messages_compose_to_requesters }}**.

{% cut "Incorrect actions by the requester" %}

If you receive spam, or if someone tries to obtain your contact information or suggests installing any programs, [write to the support service](support.md#contact).

{% note info %}

Please don't send duplicate requests or ask for a faster response. The support service reviews all incoming requests. You will receive a reply within a few days.

{% endnote %}

{% endcut %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Questions about field projects" %}

{% cut "Can a project be rejected if a person or a car license plate number is in the shot?" %}

When requesters review projects, they primarily check whether they are completed according to the instructions. However, according to Section 3.5 of the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}), you can't submit photos or videos of third parties or car license plates. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether the requester accepts the project or not. Your account might still be blocked for violation of the User Agreement, and you won't be able to withdraw money from Toloka (Section 8.5.3). Therefore, carefully check the photos and videos you're submitting for whether they contain vehicle number plates or other people's faces.
If the project asks you to take photos of strangers or car license plates, don't complete it and contact the Toloka support service. We will check the project, suspend it, or ask the requester to make changes to it so that the project complies with [Toloka]({{ toloka }}) rules.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Is it legal to take photos of organizations?" %}

According to the law, you are allowed to take photos on the street and in stores and transfer this information to third parties.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I want to make a badge with the Yandex logo to complete field projects" %}

According to Section 5.8 of the [User Agreement]({{ user-agreement }}), you work for Yandex as an independent contractor. Therefore, you can't use the logo, badge, or another ID that indicates your professional affiliation with Yandex or [Toloka]({{ toloka }}).

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Why do I need to take photos in field projects?" %}

The photos you take help improve map services and make online maps and directories more complete, useful, and up-to-date.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "What do I do if the employees of organizations ask questions or don't allow me to take photos?" %}

If the employees of organizations ask you what you're collecting information for, explain that you're completing a project on the [Toloka]({{ toloka }}) platform. Your goal is to verify information about a business's presence at a certain address and its working hours. The accuracy and reliability of this information is in the interests of the organization itself, because it will be published in directories and on online maps. If the employees of organizations tell you that you're filming illegally, explain that you're not collecting any personally identifiable information such as people's faces and car license plate numbers. All photos will be further processed according to all applicable privacy laws. If the employees of organizations don't allow you to enter the building and take photos, try to politely explain the legality of your actions. If this doesn't help, don't get into a conflict, and refuse the project.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I can't complete a project in a remote place" %}

If you can't complete the project according to the instructions, refuse it.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "There are no field projects" %}

The availability of field projects in specific cities depends on a number of factors: the needs of requesters, the epidemiological situation in the region, and so on. If there are currently no field projects in your city, it means that requesters have suspended their placement for some reason. Check the map from time to time. You'll see the projects when they appear.

{% endcut %}

{% endcut %}

{% cut "I want to take a certain type of project, but it's not in the list anymore" %}

If the project you liked is no longer displayed, it may have already been completed or you don't meet the selection criteria set by the requester. While this project is absent, you can take other ones. The desired projects may appear again later.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Can I complete projects in a foreign language?" %}

Yes, if you are fluent enough in it.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "What should I do if I received a project that I do not want to complete?" %}

If you don't want to complete a project from the list, don't start doing it. If you started a project, but you can't or don't want to complete the page that opens, go to the next one (use the {% if platform=="web" %}**{{ ui_worker_new-task-page__skip-button }}**{% elsif platform=="android" %}**{{ mobile_android_task_skip }}**{% elsif platform=="ios" %}**Skip**{% endif %}) button. Only fully completed projects are paid for.

If you no longer want to complete this project, use the **Exit** button.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "How do I stop project completion correctly if I decided to take a break?" %}

Click the **Exit** button.

If you answered all the questions on the page, click the **Send** button. When a new page loads, click **Exit**.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "There are no projects in the list" %}

This happens because of the filters you set. Sometimes, Tolokers set up filters and then forget to disable them.
Make sure that:
- You chose at least one requester and at least one project category in the {% if platform=="web" %}[task list](../task-select.md){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios"%}project list{% endif %}.
- You specified the correct language in the {% if platform=="web" %}[profile]({{ toloka-profile }}){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios"%}profile{% endif %}.
- You linked your phone number to your [Yandex ID]({{ passport-phones }}).
- You are not connected via a server located in Switzerland (this may happen if you are using an [anonymizer]({{ anonymizer }}), [VPN]({{ vpn }}) or [proxy server]({{ proxy-server }})).

{% note info %}

If you are willing to complete projects that are marked 18+, check that the **{{ ui_core_profile_editor__label__allow_adult }}** option is turned on in your {% if platform=="web" %}[profile]({{ toloka-profile }}){% elsif platform=="android" or platform=="ios" %}profile{% endif %}.

{% endnote %}

If the problem persists, contact the [support service](support.md#contact) and attach:

- A screenshot of your {% if platform=="android" or platform=="ios" %}profile{% elsif platform=="web" %}[profile]({{ toloka-profile }}){% endif %} in Toloka.
