# UHRS - Public FAQ

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions related to work with UHRS. UHRS (Universal Human Relevance System) is a crowdsourcing platform that supports data labeling with the help of millions of people around the world.

{% cut "How are projects from UHRS structured? Will there be any problems in Toloka due to the fact that I am switching to another platform?" %}

In some Toloka projects you can face integration with UHRS. It is agreed with the administration of our platform and does not violate the rules of Toloka.

To complete the project, you do not need to register on third-party sites. You open the project in Toloka and follow a unique link to UHRS, where you can perform projects available to you for two hours. In terms of content, they usually correspond to the subject of the original project. At the end of the session you will receive a bonus in Toloka. Please note that bonus may not be forwarded to your Toloka account right away, normally this process takes about 2 hours but no more than 24 hours. If it takes longer don't hesitate [to let us know](troubleshooting/support.md#contact) so that we can look into the issue

{% cut "Is it possible to perform UHRS projects in Toloka and under another vendor at the same time?" %}

Toloka does not impose any restrictions on the execution of projects in other services. But according to the author's rule a user should use a single platform to access UHRS. If you use Toloka to perform UHRS projects, you should not use your account on Clickworker or any other vendor for UHRS.

{% endcut %}

{% cut "Why don't I see any projects on UHRS?" %}

The authors of projects established stricter criteria for selecting annotators on the UHRS platform. If UHRS projects have never been available to you or if they suddenly disappeared, this may be because:

- Your account doesn't meet one or more criteria for a particular project or the UHRS platform in general. For example, your location and the number of confirmed languages in your profile matter.
  Make sure that:
  - The location in your profile matches your real location and the geolocation settings on your device. If the data is incorrect or there are differences, you may be banned from accessing the projects.
    Don't use VPN, anonymizers, or any other services that change your location data.
  - You have selected no more than 3 languages in your profile (unconfirmed languages are also taken into account).
- The author restricted your access to projects because you made a lot of mistakes. The author monitors every user's activity on the UHRS platform and can suspend your access to projects if you make a lot of mistakes or don't follow instructions. Please note: if your access is restricted, you aren't notified about this in Toloka.
- No more projects are available. The number of projects and UHRS projects available may change over time. If a particular project isn't on the list right now, it may appear later.
