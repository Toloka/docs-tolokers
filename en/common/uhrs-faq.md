# UHRS - Public FAQ

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions related to work with UHRS. UHRS (Universal Human Relevance System) is a crowdsourcing platform that supports data labeling with the help of millions of people around the world.

{% cut "How are tasks from UHRS structured? Will there be any problems in Toloka due to the fact that I am switching to another platform?" %}

In some Toloka tasks you can face integration with UHRS. It is agreed with the administration of our platform and does not violate the rules of Toloka.

To complete the task, you do not need to register on third-party sites. You open the task in Toloka and follow a unique link to UHRS, where you can perform tasks available to you for two hours. In terms of content, they usually correspond to the subject of the original project. At the end of the session you will receive a reward in Toloka. Please note that reward may not be forwarded to your Toloka account right away, normally this process takes about 2 hours but no more than 24 hours. If it takes longer don't hesitate [to let us know](troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#no_tasks) so that we can look into the issue.

{% cut "Is it possible to perform UHRS tasks in Toloka and under another vendor at the same time?" %}

Toloka does not impose any restrictions on the execution of tasks in other services. But according to the author's rule a user should use a single platform to access UHRS. If you use Toloka to perform UHRS tasks, you should not use your account on Clickworker or any other vendor for UHRS.

{% cut "Why don't I see any tasks on UHRS?" %}

The authors of tasks in Toloka can set different filters to distribute their tasks via our platform. If you don't see the project you are interested in the list on main page, it may be due to one of the reasons:

- there project is inactive at the moment
- your account characteristics do not satisfy one or more criteria set by the project author
- the author restricted your access to the project.
