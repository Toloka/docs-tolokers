{% cut "How do tasks from UHRS work? Will I face any problems in Toloka due to switching to another platform?" %}

Some Toloka tasks may be integrated with UHRS. This is approved by the Toloka administration.

To perform a task, you don't need to register with third-party websites. Open a task in Toloka and follow the unique link to switch to UHRS, where you can complete available tasks within two hours. Their content usually matches the original project's topic. At the end of your session, you'll get paid in Toloka. Please note that money can be credited to your Toloka account with a delay. This usually takes 2 hours, but it all cases it will be no longer than 24 hours. If it takes more time, [contact us](troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md#no_tasks) so that we can resolve the issue.

{% cut "Can I perform UHRS tasks in Toloka and another service at the same time?" %}

Toloka doesn't impose any restrictions on completing tasks in third-party services. However, according to the UHRS rules, users can only use one service to access this platform. If you're using Toloka to perform UHRS tasks, don't use your account in Clickworker or another service for UHRS.

{% cut "Why don't I see tasks in UHRS?" %}

Requesters in Toloka can set different filters to distribute their tasks through our platform. If you don't see the desired project in the list on the homepage, this may be due to one of the following:

- The project is currently inactive.
- Your account's characteristics don't meet one or more criteria set by the project author.
- The author limited your access to the project.
